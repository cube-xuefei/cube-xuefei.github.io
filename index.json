Environmental interventions have been proposed as effective solutions. Research has traditionally focused on the link between physical environment and children's mental health, but recent studies have shifted focus towards understanding the mechanisms underlying these associations, emphasizing the mediating role of children’s health-related behaviors. Although a few studies have suggested the influence of place perceptions on children's play behaviors, no explicit relationships between perceptions and children's emotional health status have been explored. Furthermore, most studies regarding children’s perceptions adopted small-scale questionnaires and interviews, limiting the generalizability of their findings. To address these limitations, this study employed deep neural networks and Google Street View images (GSVs) to estimate children's perceptions of neighborhoods across Hong Kong. The results revealed a correlation between children's emotional well-being and the perceived interestingness of neighborhoods, with less emotional disorder in more interesting areas. Additionally, factors like neighborhood building density, access to open spaces, parks, and sports facilities were linked to children's emotional status, influenced by household income and children's physical health. Interesting areas were often found in parks and green spaces, while less interesting areas were common in residential zones. We highlighted the advantages of Google Street View images in providing rich visual data, while also recognized their limitations in matching survey data. We further suggested implications for city-level land use planning and neighborhood-level interventions to improve children's well-being by considering factors like neighborhood design and safety, residential density, and access to sports facilities. Future perspectives of this study involve the need to address the Uncertain Geographic Context Problem and to build child-specific Street View datasets to predict children's community perceptions in a more accurate way.","tags":null,"title":"Do neighborhood subjective perceptions affect children’s emotional health?

Objectives:To build an accurate predictive model for patients who have sRCC by investigating the important characteristics that influence the overall survival of patients. Design and Methods:The Surveillance, Epidemiology and Results (SEER) database of the U.S. National Cancer Institute was used for gathering the dataset of sRCC patients. Following data preprocessing, the data was separated into the training set and the test set in an 8:2 ratio. Mann-Whitney U test and Chi-square test were used to verify whether the data set was evenly divided. Univariate Cox proportional hazard model, Kaplan-Meier analysis and machine learning (ML) algorithm were employed to identify the risk features on overall survival (OS). 10 reliable features were selected to construct six ML models. Model performance, predictive accuracy, and clinical benefits were evaluated by the receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC), calibration plots, and decision curve analysis (DCA) respectively. Results:After data preprocessing, 692 patients with sRCC from 1975 to 2019 were included in this study. Ten variables including stage group, T stage, M stage, age, surgery, N stage, tumor size, chemotherapy, histological grade, and radiotherapy were selected as reliable features for machine learning model training. All the models show good prediction performance, among which XGBoost has the best prediction accuracy and stability. The DCA showed that all models except Adaboost could be used to support clinical decision-making with the 90-day, 1-, 2-, 3- and 5-year OS model. Conclusions:Six machine learning models were developed to predict 90-day, 1-, 2-, 3- and 5-year overall survival in patients with sRCC. Model evaluations showed that the XGBoost model had the best predictive accuracy and clinical net benefit. These models can help make treatment decisions for patients with sRCC.","tags":null,"title":"Sarcomatoid renal cell carcinoma prognosis prediction based on the machine learning algorithm (Major revision)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xuefei Qin"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1667779200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1667779200,"objectID":"2fd27a635b3c24e5941f6da076acdcb0","permalink":"https://example.com/publication/ses-predict/","publishdate":"2022-11-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ses-predict/","section":"publication","summary":"Urban crime poses a serious challenge to urban sustainability and livability. Many studies have been conducted to explore the patterns and causes of urban crime, as well as prevention techniques. Studies have found that neighborhood socioeconomic status affects the incidence of urban crime, but studies on this topic are limited due to data limitations. To fill this gap, this study designed an approach for Brooklyn, USA, that collects publicly available data from housing advertising sites and the Open Street Map and trains a machine learning model to predict fine-grained neighborhood socioeconomic status. The experimental results show that the gradient boosting decision tree regression model has the best prediction accuracy. Then, we verified the predicted significant correlation between fine-grained neighborhood socioeconomic status and criminal activity in the precinct by using a geographically weighted regression model, that is, criminal activity has a higher incidence in disadvantaged neighborhoods. It was also found that neighbourhood socioeconomic status was the best predictor of harassment and burglary.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Correlation between fine-grained neighborhood socioeconomic status distribution and crime rates in New York City based on machine learning (Preprint)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xuefei Qin","吳恩達"],"categories":["Demo","教程"],"content":"import libr print(\u0026#39;hello\u0026#39;) Overview The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.
